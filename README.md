# üîê Vaultify ‚Äî Secure Secrets Management in Go

Vaultify is a lightweight, secure secrets manager built in **Go**, designed to simulate a production-ready system that stores and retrieves encrypted credentials for services and users. It supports **token-based access control**, **file-backed encrypted storage**, **PostgreSQL metadata tracking**, and **Prometheus-based observability**.

This project was built as part of a deep dive into distributed systems, backend infrastructure, and systems engineering ‚Äî with alignment to real-world expectations at companies like Meta, Google, and Stripe.

## Features

- üîê Encrypted secret storage (AES-GCM)
- ü™™ Token-based access authorization
- üóÇÔ∏è PostgreSQL-backed metadata (TTL, versioning, audit trails)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable via VIM-editable YAML (`vaultify.yml`)
- üìà Prometheus `/metrics` and `/healthz` endpoints
- üìú Unix-style access logs (tail, grep friendly)
- üìÅ File-backed secret blobs with secure key rotation 
- üêç Python-based benchmarking scripts

All deployed using Docker Compose
```

## Getting Started

###  1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nikhathfirdose1/Vaultify.git
cd Vaultify
```

###  2. Build and run

```bash
go build -o vaultify ./cmd/vaultify
./vaultify --config ./config/vaultify.yml
```

> `vaultify.yml` contains server, DB, and encryption settings.

Or use Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```
> This launches Vaultify, PostgreSQL, and Prometheus in one step using `docker-compose.yml`.


### 3. Store a secret (HTTP Example)

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/fetch/API_KEY \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer abc123"

```

###  4. Fetch a secret

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/fetch/API_KEY \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN"
```

---

## Configuration (`vaultify.yml`)

```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
  log_path: ./logs/access.log

encryption:
  key_path: ./config/master.key
  rotate_days: 30

database:
  host: vaultify-db
  port: 5432
  user: vaultadmin
  password: securepass
  name: vaultdb
```

---

## Observability

- `GET /metrics` ‚Äî Prometheus scrape endpoint
- `GET /healthz` ‚Äî basic service health check
- `logs/access.log` ‚Äî structured logs in Unix format

- Prometheus /metrics endpoint + internal /healthz for liveness checks

---

##  Benchmarking

Use the included `scripts/benchmark.py` to simulate concurrent storage and fetch operations.

```bash
cd vaultify
python3 scripts/benchmark.py
```

## Health & Metrics

- `GET /healthz` ‚Üí returns 200 OK
- `GET /metrics` ‚Üí exposes Go runtime + custom metrics
- Unix-style access logs written to `logs/access.log`


## Motivation

Vaultify was created to showcase production-grade backend skills through a real-world, security-first system. It emphasizes:

- Observability
- Systems resilience
- Secure file storage
- Config-driven architecture
- CLI-centric workflows (VIM, bash, logs)
